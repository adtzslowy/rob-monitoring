## ROB Monitoring – Early Warning System

ROB Monitoring is a real-time environmental monitoring dashboard built to track and visualize coastal flood (ROB) risk indicators. The system continuously collects and displays sensor data such as water level, wind speed, air pressure, humidity, temperature, and wind direction.

The dashboard provides live updates, risk classification (SIAGA, AWAS, BAHAYA), interactive trend charts, and detailed sensor history through modal-based visualizations.

## 🚀 Features

Real-time data updates using Livewire polling

Dynamic risk level detection with visual indicators

Interactive charts powered by Chart.js

Sensor-based modal visualization

Responsive dashboard UI with Tailwind CSS

Clean sidebar navigation with dropdown support

Lightweight frontend interaction (Vanilla JS)
